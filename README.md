Developed a chatbot written in Python using the pyttsx3 and speech_recognition libraries. This chatbot can communicate via text and speech.
In this example, the chatbot responds to the user's input with pre-defined statements. You can modify the conversation function to include more complex logic or call other APIs for more advanced functionality.
I am adding one more advance ChatBot to the platform, the chatbot uses Microsoft DialoGPT API for pretraining. It is a ChatBot class with all necessary modules to make a complete conversation.
The code in the ChatBot2 is a Python class definition for a chatbot. It initializes the chatbot with necessary modules to make a complete conversation. The class has several methods such as __init__, speak, listen, and welcome. The __init__ method initializes the chat history, input ids, and other necessary modules. The speak method uses pyttsx3 to convert text to speech. The listen method uses Speech Recognition to convert speech to text and then calls the user_input and bot_response methods. The welcome method greets the user and introduces the chatbot.
