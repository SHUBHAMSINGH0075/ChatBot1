Developed a chatbot written in Python using the pyttsx3 and speech_recognition libraries. This chatbot can communicate via text and speech.
In this example, the chatbot responds to the user's input with pre-defined statements. You can modify the conversation function to include more complex logic or call other APIs for more advanced functionality.
I have developed some more advanced chatbots using Microsoft DialoGPT and Open AI API.
